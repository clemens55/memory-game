# Memory Game Project

This project is based on HTML, CSS and JacaScript code. It's an interactive copy of the well-known "Memory Game".

### How to Play

You start the game by clicking on a flip-card. This works because of an EventListener. After selecting every pairs with the same pictures, the game automatically stops and you receive some game statics, like time and star-rating. When you got 3 stars, you are an absolute pro at this game.
